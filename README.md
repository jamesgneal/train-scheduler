# Train Scheduler
### Homework Assignment 7 - Build a train schedule tool utilizing Firebase
#### Summary
Simple web app to utilize the google's Firebase database. Using a simple html form with bootstrap, the user inputs the simple train schedule data - the name of the train, destination, time of the first departure, and frequency. The data is captured with javascript and written to Firebase. 

The data is then pulled from Firebase (every time the page loads, as well as when the submit button is clicked) and loaded into the html page's table of trains. The next train, as well as the minutes remaining until its arrival, are calculated from the current time using Moment.js.
